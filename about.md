Hello everyone, I am a Taiwanese-American who was born in Maryland 21 years ago.  
I'm currently a fourth year Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego  to pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree and am passionate in coding as well as learning the modern technology.

### More Information

Two years after my birth, my parents decided to bring me back to Taiwan, a place with full of passionate and caring people, where I spent my childhood and part of my teenage time. I came back to the States for educational purpose when I was 15 years old.

I started with ESL (English as Second Language) classes and ended up with a 2.7 GPA for my first year in High School. I was disappointed in myself when I learned about my grade. I told myself that this is my first year studying in the States, so some difficulties (language, culture, and hardship to be independent) could possibly influent my education. However, I also told myself that I have to stop being frustrated and start finding the path to success which at the moment was getting a good grade while taking care of my sister and myself. I spent a summer to study in English and learned more about the culture of the U.S.A. At the end of the next year, I got straight Aâ€™s in my academic performance and started attending Pasadena College to take some G.E. courses throughout my Junior and Senior years in High School. 

After graduating from High School, I became a full-time student at Pasadena City College, and I transferred to UCSD as Computer Science major after two years with Dean's Honor. While studying as full-time student at UCSD, I spent my spare time with my housemates and few classmates on mobile application development, and we also attended hackTECH Hackathon and LAHack Hackathon to learn more about the market of software engineering. As of now, I am developing a social application in android in a team of 4 people, and we expect to publish it in the near future.
